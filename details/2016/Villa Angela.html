<p>Villa Angela beach and Euclid beach are part of Lakefront Reservation, operated by <a href="http://www.clevelandmetroparks.com/Main/Aquatics1/6.aspx" target="_blank">Cleveland Metroparks</a> (<a href="http://www.clevelandmetroparks.com/Uploads/Public/Documents/Reservations/DrivingDirections/Euclid-Creek-Reservation-Driving-Directions.pdf" target="_blank">driving directions</a>).</p>

<p>The information on this page is updated by the <a href="http://www.neorsd.org/nowcast-advisories.php" target="_blank">Northeast Ohio Regional Sewer District</a> by 11:30 AM (EDT) every day during the swimming season and is intended to inform the public of water quality advisories based on the bacteria levels in the bathing waters. This nowcast issues advisories and predicts the probability once a day at the posted time only. There are other factors such as waves, currents, algae or other dangers that would prompt a Beach Manager to issue a No Swim Advisory.  Storms are likely to result in a quick change in water quality. Please click  <a href="http://www.clevelandmetroparks.com/swimming/" target="_blank">here</a> to view the current swimming status.</p>

<p>Beach water quality information at Villa Angela and Euclid and other beaches around Ohio is also available through <a href="http://publicapps.odh.ohio.gov/BeachGuardPublic/Default.aspx" target="_blank">BeachGuard</a>, operated by Ohio Department of Health.</p>

<h5><b>Variables used in the Villa Angela/Euclid nowcast backup model</b></h5>

<p>Results from a rapid analytical method for <i>Escherichia coli</i> (<i>E. coli</i>) &#8212; quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) &#8212; are used to provide water-quality advisory information at Villa Angela and Euclid.   A standard curve is created by analyzing known quantities of <i>E. coli</i> by culture and qPCR; daily sample values are then extrapolated from the standard curve.  <b>If results indicate inhibition of qPCR or results for qPCR are not available for any other reason, a nowcast backup model is used.</b></p>

<p>The variables below will be used in a nowcast backup model to predict the probability of exceeding beach action value of 235 most-probable number/100 mL (MPN/100 mL). If the probability exceeds the established threshold (37%), the beach is posted with a water-quality warning.</p>
