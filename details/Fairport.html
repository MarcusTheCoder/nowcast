<p>Fairport Harbor beach is operated by <a href="http://www.lakemetroparks.com/parks/fairport-harbor.shtml" target="_blank">Lake Metroparks</a> and monitored by the <a href="http://www.lcghd.org/" target="_blank">Lake County General Health District</a>.  The nowcast has been used at Fairport Harbor since 2014.</p>

<p>The information on this page is updated by the <a href="http://www.lcghd.org/" target="_blank">Lake County General Health District</a> by 10:30 AM (EDT) every day during the swimming season. This nowcast issues advisories and predicts the probability once a day at the posted time only. Storms are likely to result in a quick change in water quality.</p>

<p>Beach water quality information at Fairport Harbor and other beaches around Ohio is also available through <a href="http://publicapps.odh.ohio.gov/BeachGuardPublic/Default.aspx" target="_blank">BeachGuard</a>, operated by Ohio Department of Health.</p>

<h5><b>Variables used in the Fairport Harbor nowcast model</b></h5>

<p>The variables below will be used in a model to predict the probability of exceeding the <i>Escherichia coli</i> (<i>E. coli</i>) beach action value of 235 most-probable number/100 mL (MPN/100 mL).  If the probability exceeds the established threshold, the beach is posted with a swimming advisory. During 2017, there is one full-season model for Fairport Harbor and one backup model if local weather data are not available for the nowcast.</p>

<p>The USGS operates a <a href="https:waterdata.usgs.gov/oh/nwis/uv?site_no=414514081174400" target="_blank">weather station at Mentor Headlands</a> to measure wind speed, wind direction, barometric pressure, air temperature, net solar radiation, incident light, and rainfall.</p>
