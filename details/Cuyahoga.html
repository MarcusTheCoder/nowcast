<p>The Cuyahoga River at Jaite (Brecksville, Oh) is in the <a href="http://www.nps.gov/cuva/" target="_blank">Cuyahoga Valley National Park</a>.</p>

<p>This is a test of the nowcast for the Cuyahoga River. The nowcast issues advisories and predicts the concentrations of <i>Escherichia coli</i> (<i>E. coli</i>) once a day at the posted time only. The predicted concentrations are for a specific site along the river and are for information only. Storms are likely to result in a quick change in water quality. Please be aware that there are no formal boat/canoe put-in locations at this river site. Cuyahoga Valley National Park is presently developing strategies to protect and enhance river values, including adequate and safe approaches for recreational river use.</p>

<p>While use of the river is not prohibited, there are several concerns that should be taken into consideration:</p>

<ul>
<li>
Canoeing and kayaking the river can be dangerous and the park does not maintain the river for paddling.
</li>
<li>There are no developed access points or launch facilities for paddlers in CVNP.
</li>
<li>
Paddle at your own risk &#8212; you are responsible for your own safety. Always be aware of your surroundings, weather and water level. Know your equipment, limits and skills. Don't paddle alone, and let someone know your plans and when you expect to return.

<p>In previous years, water-quality standards set the single-sample maximum at 298 <i>E. coli</i> per 100 milliliters. Current water quality standards (Ohio EPA, 2017) do not specify a not-to-exceed numeric criterion in a single sample for primary-contact recreation. However, a &#8220;beach action value&#8221; of 235 <i>E. coli</i> per 100 milliliters, which is more protective in regards to public health, is specified in the Administrative Code. Therefore, for the purposes of determining recreational water-quality conditions in the Cuyahoga River, the beach action value will be used as a benchmark to evaluate water quality.</p>

<h5><b>Variables used in the Cuyahoga River nowcast model</b></h5>

<p>For the Cuyahoga River at Jaite, a model based on turbidity as measured by the in-situ turbidity sensor and radar-indicated rainfall as observed near the Akron-Fulton International Airport will be used for the nowcast in 2017. On days when the predicted <i>E. coli</i> concentrations in the river are below 235 <i>E. coli</i> per 100 milliliters, the water quality will be considered &#8220;good&#8221;.</p>
